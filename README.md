# Hey! 안녕하세요! 👋

I'm a physics student at UCL, and I enjoy learning new things!

## 🔭 Current Interests 

- **Quantum Mechanics**: I find quantum mechanics one as one of the most interesting branch in Physics. It feels like I know less as I learn more though.
- **NLP and LLM's**: Currently, I'm exploring LLM fine-tuning with META's LLaMA, learning more about machine learning and natural language processing. 
- **Qiskit**: In my free time, I'm starting to learn the basics of quantum computing through Qiskit, expanding my horizons in this field. 

## ⚛️ Skills

- **Python**: I'm eager to learn new languages but currently im focusing on mastering python. 
- **Linux**: As a non-CS student, I was not familiar with different operating systems. I am starting my exploration with Linux. 

## 🎯 Next Goals
